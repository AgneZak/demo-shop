# Technical assignment

Welcome to our Front-End Developer technical assignment! We're excited to have you on board and appreciate your interest in joining our team.
This assignment is designed to assess your skills and creativity while working on a simple project.
We want to emphasize that you don't have to strive for perfection â€“ we're interested in seeing your approach, your ability to adapt and learn, and your problem-solving skills.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarification.

You'll be working with the Fake Store API to create a responsive web shop listing page with essential filtering features.
Additionally, you will have the opportunity to implement a wishlist feature and individual item listing pages.
We've also included some optional bonus tasks that you can choose to tackle based on your interests and skills.
These are entirely optional, so feel free to select the ones that align with your strengths and preferences.

## Project Requirements

1. **Data Source:** Fetch data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs).
2. **Version Control:** Clone the project repository and create a pull request to your own `master` branch and add `iterato` as collaborator (so we can review your changes).
3. **Version Control Guidelines:** Split your work into separate, descriptive, and meaningful commits for better code management and review.

## Front-End Development

1. **Front-End Framework:** Utilize Vuetify to create a responsive web shop listing page with essential filtering functions, including sorting and search.
2. **Wishlist Functionality:** Implement a wishlist feature that allows users to toggle items and view their wishlist.
3. **Item Detail Page:** Create individual item listing pages using data obtained from the Fake Store API.

## Bonus Tasks (Optional)

Choose as many or as few of the following tasks as you prefer to enhance the project:

1. **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests to cover at least one of the project components for robust testing.
2. **Internationalization:** Implement internationalization (i18n) features to support multiple languages.
3. **Shopping Cart and Checkout:** Add a shopping cart and checkout functionality for a complete shopping experience.
4. **Docker Configuration:** Include Docker configuration to facilitate project deployment and management.
5. **TypeScript Integration:** Utilize TypeScript in your code for improved type checking and code quality.
